    "Description": "Adventure Quest is an interactive, dynamic experience that included click-through quests as well as open-world character navigation in a two-dimensional space. While similar games or experiences follow a more linear direction of game/character development, we designed our Adventure Quest with an emphasis on surprise and high re-playability. The choices a user makes will not only affect future outcomes of upcoming quests, but those outcomes themselves can change upon a second playthrough even if other factors such as previous choices and character attribute points remain constant. This is due to the randomness generator we implemented that, while fully taking into account the character attribute points the user puts in, will always leave open a chance for the failure of a given choice (or in likewise fashion, its success)."

    "Description": "This app is a remake of the Scholastic I Spy picture books in which the reader uses rhyming clues to find hidden objects in a cluttered still life photograph. We wanted to play with the nostalgia of a game that was so endearing to us as children and also make a game that would continue to be fun for kids and adults while maintaining the visual essence of the books. It's timelessness stems from its ability to both build and engage skills that are useful for all ages like attention to detail, thoughtful observation - the things that you’re looking for are not always how they appear! - and cooperative play; it’s a game that is most fun when you play and win together. Io Spio invites users to create an account, and select one of our puzzles to play. We offer multiple timer and difficulty settings, as well as an optional music player. Each map has hidden objects to find, for which you will score points. Users can check their previous scores and clear times on the results page, to keep track of their Object finding prowess. Try our credits page puzzle for additional fun!"
